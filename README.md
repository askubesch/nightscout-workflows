# Nightscout Workflows

[Workflow] is an iOS app that allows you to create automated workflows from your phone or iPad. Nightscout Workflows is a collection of these workflows designed to make reading and writing information to and from Nightscout, and CarePortal in particular, as simple and painless as possible.

### Installation
You first need to make sure Workflow is installed on your device. 

[Get Workflow App]

Click on one of the links below to get the desired workflow. Workflow will ask for a few inputs (i.e.: your Nightscout URL). You can make additional customizations and configurations from within the app. You must click on the link(s) below from within Safari. If you're coming from Facebook, use the "open this page in Safari" option before clicking on the link(s) below. 

### Workflows
 - [Meter BG] Simple workflow to enter a metered blood glucose value and save to CarePortal. *** When asked for your Nightscout URL, add /api/v1/treatments.json to the end. This is a temporary workaround. ***

### Todos

 - Lots - just getting started
 - Add several other workflows. Suggestions are welcomed, so please feel free to submit issues. Pull requests are even better.
 - Add screenshots to README
 - Add instructions and screenshots for adding a workflow to your homescreen, to the today widget, and to Apple Watch.
